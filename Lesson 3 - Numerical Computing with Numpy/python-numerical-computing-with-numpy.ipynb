Code cells can be executed and their outputs e.g. numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files etc. can be viewed within the notebook, which makes it a really powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't afraid to experiment with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encoutering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top of the notebook.\n","\n","### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n","\n","The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks.

Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Install the required Python libraries within the environmebt by the running the following command on your  terminal or command prompt:\n","```\n","pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn --upgrade\n","```\n","\n","4. Download the notebook for this tutorial using the `jovian clone` command:\n","```\n","jovian clone aakashns/python-numerical-computing-with-numpy\n","```\n","The notebook is downloaded to the directory `python-numerical-computing-with-numpy`.\n","\n","\n","5.
