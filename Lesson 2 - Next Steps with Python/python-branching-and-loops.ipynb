You can \"run\" this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your own computer*.\n","\n",">  This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of \"cells\", which can contain explanations in text or code written in Python. Code cells can be executed and their outputs e.g. numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files etc. can be viewed within the notebook, which makes it a really powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't afraid to experiment with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encoutering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top of the notebook.\n","\n","### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n","\n","The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n","\n","\n","### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","You'll need to install Python and download this notebook on your computer to run in locally. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) distribution of Python. Here's what you need to do to get started:\n","\n","1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Make sure to add Conda binaries to your system `PATH` to be able to run the `conda` command line tool from your Mac/Linux terminal or Windows command prompt. \n","\n","\n","2. Create and activate a [Conda virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) called `zerotopandas` which you can use for this tutorial series:\n","```\n","conda create -n intro-to-python -y python=3.8 \n","conda activate intro-to-python\n","```\n","You'll need to create the environment only once, but you'll have to activate it every time want to run the notebook. When the environment is activated, you should be able to see a prefix `(intro-to-python)` within your terminal or command prompt.\n","\n","\n","3. Install the required Python libraries within the environmebt by the running the following command on your  terminal or command prompt:\n","```\n","pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn --upgrade\n","```\n","\n","4. Download the notebook for this tutorial using the `jovian clone` command:\n","```\n","jovian clone aakashns/python-branching-and-loops\n","```\n","The notebook is downloaded to the directory `python-branching-and-loops`.\n","\n","\n","5. Enter the project directory and start the Jupyter notebook:\n","```\n","cd python-branching-and-loops\n","jupyter notebook\n","```\n","\n","6. You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser. Click on the notebook `python-branching-and-loops.ipynb` to open it and run the code.

This makes Python code easy to read and understand, but you can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. \n","\n","\n","As an example, let's write some code to check and print a message if a given number is even."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sFk9XMyyZ2cD","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599752828820,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":933,"user":{"displayName":"fernandes macedo","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhJ9tjvclcdi3RHHRxHgDuwJ2JOnJiNPr2TJokJ=s64","userId":"06599801896491279741"}}},"source":["a_number = 34"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XITi7RqNZ2cH","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":50},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599752830623,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":942,"user":{"displayName":"fernandes macedo","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhJ9tjvclcdi3RHHRxHgDuwJ2JOnJiNPr2TJokJ=s64","userId":"06599801896491279741"}},"outputId":"1324edc1-3b62-44f7-d4d9-f148cec85c52"},"source":["if a_number % 2 == 0:\n","    print(\"We're inside an if block\")\n","    print('The given number {} is even.'.format(a_number))"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["We're inside an if block\n","The given number 34 is even.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ecg9i19SZ2cM","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Note that we are using the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder from the division of `a_number` by `2`, and then we are using the comparision operator `==` check if the reminder is `0`, indicating that the number is divisible by 2 i.e. it is even. \n","\n","Since the number `34` is indeed divisible by `2` the expression `a_number % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`, so the `print` statement under the `if` statement is executed.
